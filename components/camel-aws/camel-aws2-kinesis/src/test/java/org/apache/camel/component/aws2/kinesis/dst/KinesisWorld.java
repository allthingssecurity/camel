/**
 * The world around a camel-aws2-kinesis consumer: a fake Kinesis data stream ({@link FakeKinesis}), a producer, a route
 * whose processing is sometimes slow (now and then longer than the five minutes a shard iterator is valid) and
 * sometimes fails, and an operator that restarts the route, suspends it (for up to eight minutes, so that the cached
 * shard iterators expire) and resumes it, and reshards the stream (a split closes a shard and opens two child shards, a
 * merge closes two and opens one). Faults: GetRecords, GetShardIterator and ListShards fail, calls answer slowly,
 * GetRecords returns fewer records than it could.
 * <p>
 * The seed picks the iterator type (TRIM_HORIZON or LATEST), whether the route checkpoints with the resumable EIP and
 * KinesisResumeStrategy (the resume cache outlives the consumer, so a restarted route resumes from it), the number of
 * shards, maxResultsPerRequest, the poll delay, the shard monitor interval and shardClosed (ignore or silent; fail ends
 * the consumption of the stream by design).
 * <p>
 * A route restart creates a new consumer, which this world counts as an epoch. With the one-stack model, a graceful
 * stop or suspend cannot see a poll that blocks below it finish, and the shutdown strategy waits for a poll in progress
 * (the consumer counts it as a pending exchange), so the operator stops or suspends the route between two polls, after
 * it suspended the consumer (as the shutdown strategy does) so that no poll starts during the stop: a stop while a poll
 * runs is not driven. A stop can happen while the shard monitor lists the shards. The operator starts the route again
 * only once no call of the stopped consumer and no exchange is in progress.
 * <p>
 * Properties: a consumer routes each record at most once (the iterator of an expired shard continues after the last
 * record it routed), apart from a record after its checkpoint (see below); a restarted route with a checkpoint does not
 * route a checkpointed record again; once the faults cleared every record is routed (a record stored before a consumer
 * started a shard of its first shard list with a LATEST iterator is skipped by design, unless the shard has a
 * checkpoint), and the checkpoint of each open shard reaches its last record; the consumer uses the API as the
 * reference requires. Without checkpoints a failed exchange is not routed again: the consumer does not retry, by
 * design.
 * <p>
 * With checkpoints, the resume strategy decides where every new iterator of a shard starts, also after an expiry: after
 * the checkpoint, which is the last completed exchange, so a record routed after it that did not complete (it failed)
 * may be routed again by the same consumer.
 * <p>
 * Also excused, unless {@code -Ddst.kinesis.strictLatest=true}: with iteratorType=LATEST, when the iterator of a shard
 * of the first shard list from which the consumer has not routed a record yet expires, the consumer has no sequence
 * number to continue from and asks for a LATEST iterator again, which skips the records stored since its previous
 * iterator (for example while the route was suspended for more than five minutes). This is a gap of the consumer
 * itself, left out of the default set: {@code -Ddst.kinesis.strictLatest=true} shows it.
 * <p>
 * Not explored: a route stop while a poll runs (see above), the KCL consumer (useKclConsumers), the asynchronous
 * client, a configured shardId, AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER, AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER and AT_TIMESTAMP as the configured iterator
 * type.
